# CN-series 🚀 Helm Chart ⛵ 

This repo is for deploying CN-series using [Helm Package Manager for Kubernetes](https://helm.sh)

## Steps 🔢

1. Install Panorama

2. Get the Panorama IP and authKey

3. Download this repo (git clone or download the zip), and `cd cn-series-helm`

4. Update the `values.yaml` file with proper configuration

5. Make sure your kubernetes cluster is reachable and your kubeconfig file is properly set

6. Dryrun to validate the helm deployment using `helm install --dry-run --debug gunjan-cn-series .`

7. If the dryrun is successful, you can deploy the CN-series helm chart using `helm install  gunjan-cn-series .` 


PS: Maybe use a different deployment name. `gunjan-cn-series` sounds like an offshoot of the band Infected Mushroom 🍄 😃
